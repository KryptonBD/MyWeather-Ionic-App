# My Weather Mobile Application With Ionic

I created this app using Ionic and OpenWeatherMap API. The app mainly allow you to see weather. The other feature includes percentage of clouds, wind speed and direction, humidity, presuure etc.
You also can change the deafault city which shows the weather from settings. It stores the data in local storage.
## Setting Up
To run this project you need openweathermap api, which you can get from their website.

After getting the api, go to *src/services/weather.ts* file of this project. 
Where you can find `YOUR OPEN WEATHER API`, replace it with your api key. 

## Ruuning The Project
